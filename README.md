# Physics Informed Neural Network Tools

* IDRLnet

  IDRLnet, a Python toolbox for modeling and solving problems through Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) systematically.

* PINA

  PINA is an open-source Python library providing an intuitive interface for solving differential equations using PINNs, NOs or both together. Based on PyTorch and PyTorchLightning, PINA offers a simple and intuitive way to formalize a specific (differential) problem and solve it using neural networks . The approximated solution of a differential equation can be implemented using PINA in a few lines of code thanks to the intuitive and user-friendly interface.

* neurodiffeq
  
  A library for solving differential equations using neural networks based on PyTorch, used by multiple research groups around the world, including at Harvard IACS. The neurodiffeq is a package for solving differential equations with neural networks. Differential equations are equations that relate some function with its derivatives. They emerge in various scientific and engineering domains. Traditionally these problems can be solved by numerical methods (e.g. finite difference, finite element). While these methods are effective and adequate, their expressibility is limited by their function representation. It would be interesting if we can compute solutions for differential equations that are continuous and differentiable.
